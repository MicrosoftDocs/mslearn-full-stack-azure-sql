Learning path title: Build serverless, full stack applications in Azure

*Add the working title [(Title guidance)](/help/learn/id-guidance-title)*

## Role(s)

- developer
- database-administrator
- solution-architect
- devops-engineer
- student
- data-engineer

## Level

- intermediate

## Product(s)

- azure-sql-database
- github
- vs-code
- azure-functions
- azure-logic-apps


## Prerequisites
- Module: Develop modern applications with built-in capabilities of Azure SQL Database

## Summary

In the language of your choice (Node.js, Python, or .NET), deploy an Azure Function that adds real-time data to an Azure SQL Database and triggers an Azure Logic App for notifications when a bus enters a geofence. Leverage GitHub Actions for CI/CD.

## Learning objectives

1. Build backend APIs in Azure
1. Design Azure Functions in any language and integrate them with Azure SQL Database and Azure Logic Apps
1. Examine geospatial and JSON support built-in to Azure SQL Database

## Chunk your content into subtasks

Identify the subtasks of *module title*

| Subtask | What part of the introduction scenario does this subtask satisfy? | How will you assess it: **Exercise or Knowledge check**? | Which learning objective(s) does this help meet? | Does the subtask have enough learning content to justify an entire unit? If not, which other subtask will you combine it with? |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| TODO | TODO | TODO | TODO | TODO |
| TODO | TODO | TODO | TODO | TODO |
| TODO | TODO | TODO | TODO | TODO |

## Outline the units

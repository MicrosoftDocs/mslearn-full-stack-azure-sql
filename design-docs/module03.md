# Build full stack applications with Azure Static Web Apps and Azure SQL Database

Learning path title: Build serverless, full stack applications in Azure

*Add the working title [(Title guidance)](/help/learn/id-guidance-title)*

## Role(s)

- developer
- database-administrator
- solution-architect
- devops-engineer
- student
- data-engineer

## Level

- intermediate

## Product(s)

- azure-sql-database
- github
- vs-code
- azure-functions
- azure-app-service-static
- azure-web-apps


## Prerequisites
- Module: Develop modern applications with built-in capabilities of Azure SQL Database
- Module: Deploy backend APIs with Azure Functions, Logic Apps, and Azure SQL Database

## Summary

In the language of your choice (Node.js, Python, or .NET), deploy an Azure Static Web App which combines the power of Azure Functions and Azure Web Apps into one service managed by GitHub Actions. This application surfaces real-time geospatial data stored in an Azure SQL Database.

## Learning objectives

1. Create Vue.js web applications leveraging Azure Static Web Apps
1. Design APIs in any language and integrate them with Azure SQL Database and Azure Static Web Apps
1. Forumulate GitHub Actions to build CI/CD for Azure applications and services


## Chunk your content into subtasks

Identify the subtasks of *module title*

| Subtask | What part of the introduction scenario does this subtask satisfy? | How will you assess it: **Exercise or Knowledge check**? | Which learning objective(s) does this help meet? | Does the subtask have enough learning content to justify an entire unit? If not, which other subtask will you combine it with? |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| TODO | TODO | TODO | TODO | TODO |
| TODO | TODO | TODO | TODO | TODO |
| TODO | TODO | TODO | TODO | TODO |

## Outline the units

*Add more units as needed for your content*

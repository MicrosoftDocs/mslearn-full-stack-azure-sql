## Prerequisites
- Module: Develop modern applications with built-in capabilities of Azure SQL Database
- Module: Deploy backend APIs with Azure Functions, Logic Apps, and Azure SQL Database
- Module: Build full stack applications with Azure Static Web Apps and Azure SQL Database

## Summary

In the language of your choice (Node.js, Python, or .NET), deploy an end-to-end solution to solve the real-world scenario of catching the bus. You will learn how to build a solution that leverages Azure SQL Database, Azure Functions, Azure Static Web Apps, Logic Apps, Visual Studio Code and GitHub Actions. This is the final module in the learning path that puts all of the pieces together, so if there are pieces you want to go deeper into, you can review the earlier modules.

## Learning objectives

1. Build multi-service solutions in Azure which leverage Azure SQL Database
1. Create web applications quickly by leveraging Azure Static Web Apps
1. Design APIs in any language with Azure Functions 
1. Forumulate GitHub Actions to build CI/CD for Azure applications and services

## Chunk your content into subtasks

Identify the subtasks of *module title*

| Subtask | What part of the introduction scenario does this subtask satisfy? | How will you assess it: **Exercise or Knowledge check**? | Which learning objective(s) does this help meet? | Does the subtask have enough learning content to justify an entire unit? If not, which other subtask will you combine it with? |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| TODO | TODO | TODO | TODO | TODO |
| TODO | TODO | TODO | TODO | TODO |
| TODO | TODO | TODO | TODO | TODO |

## Outline the units

*Add more units as needed for your content*

1. **Introduction**

    Provide a scenario of a real-world job-task that shows how the technology is used in practice:

    *Catch the bus scenario*
